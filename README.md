## About the Conference

## About Recommender System

KDD 2019 has many recommender system (RS) articles focus on Ratings and Reviews Information, both of which received more importance in developing recommender system, to get better Stability and dynamic performance. There are still some articles discussing the robustness of RS.

More RS are starting to use deep models, such as Deep Q-learning or DNN of the class to get better accuracy that increases over time. There are also articles focus on cold starts, but not so many.

Most of the RS articles focus on the problem of recommendations in a specific context, such as road or shopping recommendations, and consider a variety of realistic scenarios, with the Rating scenario being considered more often, and the gap between the Top Rating and List-wise Rating approaches being discussed in a number of related articles, as shown in my reviewing below.

All in all, the discussion is relatively focused on RS only, and there is some commonality in the issues addressed. You may read the article or browse the Review below for more information.
